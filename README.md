# Gesture-Based Volume Control Using Hand Tracking 🎛️🖐️

This project enables touchless control of system volume using hand gestures, leveraging MediaPipe, OpenCV, and **PyAutoGUI**. The distance between your **thumb and index finger** is used to control the volume — the farther apart they are, the higher the volume.
